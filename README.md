# ChubbaMorris_0.0.1
ChubbaMorris_0.0.1 :   Front End (in typescript) to ChubbaMorris in (C++)


This project complements https://github.com/john-itcsolutions/ChubbaMorris, which is the database, blockchain or Backend 
to this project's Front End or GUI.  Further information is available on that project's README.md.

As mentioned there, the methods of connecting this package to the database/blockchain/Backend are unknown as yet.  Also 
unknown is how to deploy the C++ blockchain/database to a sidechain.

This version is so far aimed at getting an Android DApp working, writing and reading data to a sidechain,  as the first step.
